# Scrypted Add-on for Home Assistant

**THIS IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS**

## About

This add-on allows you to set up Scrypted on your Home Assistant instance.

Scrypted offers many benefits, but perhaps its most useful function is providing super-low-latency HomeKit camera streaming and support for HomeKit Secure Video.

For more information about Scrypted, visit [the Scrypted website](https://scrypted.app).

## System requirements

- Home Assistant OS or Supervised installation running on aarch64, amd64 or armv7 architecture (if you have Home Assistant Core or Container installed then install Scrypted in a separate container using the instructions at [the Scrypted GitHub page](https://github.com/koush/scrypted).
- At least 2GB free storage space
- Raspberry Pi 4 or faster machine (performance noticeably worse on Raspberry Pi 3B)

## Installation

Add the repository [https://github.com/aegjoyce/ha-addons](https://github.com/aegjoyce/ha-addons) in Home Assistant (see [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/installing_third_party_addons/) for more information).

Then select the Scrypted add-on and click Install. **This may take 5-10 minutes to complete as the image is approximately 2GB in size.**

Once installed, make sure you enable Watchdog so that the Scrypted add-on will restart automatically if you need to restart Scrypted from within its UI.

Scrypted will then be accessible via **[YOUR_HOME_ASSISTANT_ADDRESS]:10443** - check the add-on logs after clicking 'Start' to confirm the server address.

You will likely need to approve a security/certificate message the first time you access Scrypted.

For external access, make sure you forward port 10443 to your Home Assistant instance on your router.

## To-do

- Testing on different architectures to ensure compatibility (armv7 and amd64 are untested, and I have listed armhf and i386 as incompatible for now as the docker multi-arch image does not include these architectures)
- ~~WebUI support~~ - done
- Ingress support
- Apparmor support
- Try to get Scrypted to use Home Assistant certificates
- ~~Relocate Scrypted database to Config folder to allow for easier database editing/importing/exporting~~ - done
- ~~Proper implementation of changelog and versioning~~ - done
